In our project we used influxdb version 1.8.1 


Reservation feature:

In the backend we used influxdb to store the data required for implementing the reservation feature 

tags:ue
fields:busy_slots,free_slots,ue_name


time                busy_slots free_slots                                                       ue    ue_name
----                ---------- ----------                                                      -----  -----
1656591254419000000 [0,1]      [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]      ue_1  ue_1

here the elements in the list represent the slot of one hour i.e 0 represents 0:00-1:00am slot

the reservation feature seen above is not scalable and there are also few assumptions made 1.each test runs for one hour  2.all the slots start at integer hours

Reason: influxdb doesn't support list as field values, it only supports integers,strings,booleans and floats. [in the above database I have stored the slots list as string "[0,1]" and to update its values we have to convert it into a list and proceed]

So, for implementing the features like reservation and scheduling it is suggested to use MongoDB instead of an influxdb
